 # Client-Server Chat Application

 This project is a client-server chat application written in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client.

 ## Features
 - **Single Chat Room**: All connected clients share one chat room.
 - **Multi-client Support**: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously and chat with each other.
 - **Active Users**: Clients can view the list of currently active users.
 - **User Notifications**: Clients are notified when a user joins or leaves the chat.

 ## Keywords
 - **active**: Displays the list of active users.
 - **exit**: Disconnects the client from the server and exits the application.

 ## Usage
 - 1. Run the Server
 - 2. Compile and run the client as many times as needed to add multiple clients. Each instance will create a separate client connected to the same server.
 Enter a username to join the chat room and use the text field to send messages.

 - To run multiple clients in the same chat room, execute the Client_GUI module multiple times.
   Each instance will create a separate client connected to the same server.
